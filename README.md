# Bluedog-Design-Bureau (But Only The Probes)
Reduction of Bluedog Design Bureau, a stockalike parts mod for Kerbal Space Program.

What is this mod?

BDB Probe Only is a cut down version of Bluedog Design Bureau for those who only want to use the probes (and science parts) from this mod. 
BE WARNED: The mod is not as optimised as it could have been, as I am not sure what can I delete without nuking the entire mod. It is, still, a significant size reduction.
